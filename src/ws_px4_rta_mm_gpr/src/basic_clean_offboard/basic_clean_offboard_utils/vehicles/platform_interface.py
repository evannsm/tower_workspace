Platform Interface Module
==========================

This module defines the platform abstraction layer using the Strategy Pattern and
Dependency Injection to enable seamless switching between different hardware platforms
(simulation vs. real hardware) without changing core control logic.

Design Philosophy:
-----------------
1. **Abstraction over Implementation**: Define what platforms must do, not how they do it
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension (add new platforms), closed for modification
3. **Dependency Injection**: Core code depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations
4. **Registry Pattern**: Centralized mapping enables runtime platform selection

Benefits:
---------
- Add new platforms without modifying existing code
- Swap platforms at runtime by changing a single parameter
- Test with mock platforms easily
- Platform-specific details are encapsulated

Example Usage:
-------------
    # Get platform from registry using dependency injection
    platform_class = PLATFORM_REGISTRY[PlatformType.SIM]
    platform = platform_class()

    # Use platform interface consistently
    throttle = platform.get_throttle_from_force(20.0)
    mass = platform.mass

    Using StrEnum allows type-safe string comparison while maintaining

class PlatformConfig(ABC):
    """Abstract base class defining the interface all platforms must implement.

    This class uses the Template Method pattern to define the structure that all
    platform implementations must follow. Each concrete platform (GZX500, Holybro, etc.)
    must implement these methods with platform-specific logic.

    Design Rationale:
    ----------------
    - **ABC (Abstract Base Class)**: Enforces that subclasses implement all abstract methods
    - **Property for mass**: Ensures mass is read-only and consistent across platforms
    - **Conversion methods**: Encapsulates platform-specific thrust/throttle relationships

    Why this abstraction?
    --------------------
    Different platforms have different:
    - Physical properties (mass, motor constants)
    - Thrust-to-throttle conversion equations
    - Hardware constraints

    By abstracting these differences, control algorithms can work with any platform
    without knowing implementation details.

              can be computed or retrieved from configuration.

        Each platform has a unique relationship between desired thrust force
        and the throttle command sent to motors. This can be:
        - Linear (simple scaling)
        - Polynomial (empirically derived)
        - Physics-based (motor models)

            force: Desired thrust force in Newtons

        Returns:
            float: Throttle command (platform-specific range, typically 0-1)

        Example:

Platform Registry - The Dependency Injection Container
=====================================================

This registry implements the Registry Pattern and enables Dependency Injection.

How it works:
1. Main node requests a platform by type (e.g., PlatformType.SIM)
2. Registry returns the appropriate class (not instance)
3. Main node instantiates the platform
4. All subsequent code uses the platform through the abstract interface

Adding a New Platform:
---------------------
1. Create new platform class inheriting from PlatformConfig
2. Implement all abstract methods
3. Add to PLATFORM_REGISTRY
4. No other code needs to change!

Example:
    class MyNewPlatform(PlatformConfig):
        @property
        def mass(self) -> float:
            return 2.5
        # ... implement other methods

    PLATFORM_REGISTRY[PlatformType.MY_NEW] = MyNewPlatform
