def adjust_yaw(node, yaw: float) -> float:
    """Adjust yaw angle to account for full rotations and return the adjusted yaw.

    This function keeps track of the number of full rotations both clockwise and counterclockwise, and adjusts the yaw angle accordingly so that it reflects the absolute angle in radians. It ensures that the yaw angle is not wrapped around to the range of -pi to pi, but instead accumulates the full rotations.
    This is particularly useful for applications where the absolute orientation of the vehicle is important, such as in control algorithms or navigation systems.
    The function also initializes the first yaw value and keeps track of the previous yaw value to determine if a full rotation has occurred.

    Args:
        yaw (float): The yaw angle in radians from the motion capture system after being converted from quaternion to euler angles.

    Returns:
        psi (float): The adjusted yaw angle in radians, accounting for full rotations.
